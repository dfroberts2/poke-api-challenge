# poke-api-challenge

Poke Api Challenge is tiny html game that was created as an exercise in JavaScript MVC design. Users call for a random pokemon from the Pokeapi, a RESTful JSON API, and drag a pokeball image to "capture" it. Users can also drag their pokemon around to switch the order of their pokemon. This project utilized a simple HTTP server built into the bash shell.
